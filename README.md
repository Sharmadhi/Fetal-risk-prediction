Two modelling process were created in this study:
•	Vanilla modelling process.
•	Experimental modelling process.

The baseline models which were chosen were checked if they were compatible with the dataset and surprisingly, they all produced a good result. The baseline models which are taken for this analysis are: 
•	K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
•	Logistic Regression (LR)
•	Decision Tree (DT)
•	Random Forest (RF)
•	XgBoost

Future work of this study includes taking multi class predictor variables and using a larger dataset to train the model better. Other works also include taking other diagnostic metrics such as mother’s health, heart rate, smoker or non-smoker, BMI, etc.
